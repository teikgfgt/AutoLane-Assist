# AutoLane-Assist
A computer vision system using YOLO (object detection) and OpenCV to detect lane deviations, then sends corrective commands to an Arduino to adjust steering via a motorâ€”keeping the vehicle centered in its lane.  ðŸ”§ Key Technologies:  AI/ML: YOLO (real-time object detection) + OpenCV (image processing).
